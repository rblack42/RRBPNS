This project is a recreation of a project I developed in the early 1970s while
working on a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at Virginia Tech. The project was
supposed to address a full 3-D flow over a lifting body shape, but only this
axisymmetric solver was completed. I am documenting the code, rewritten in modern Fortran, including parallel processing. The code has been run on a variety of example architectures:

- MacBook Pro (M1 Max chip)
- Mac Studio (M1 chip)
- Dell Inspiron (Intel I9 chip)
- 4-node Intel NUC cluster (Intel I5 chips)

Instructions for setting up a clone of this project are included in the Appendix - see thee documentation link above.

The documentation was created usinrg *Jupyter-Book*, with support from *Python SymPy*
for math, and *LaTeX TikZ* for figures.
